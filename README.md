# Safeplaces Backend Examples

This repository holds an example backend for [Safeplaces API specification](https://github.com/Path-Check/safeplaces-backend/blob/dev/oas3.yaml).

Safeplaces is a toolkit for public health, built on top of data shared by users of [Private Kit](https://github.com/tripleblindmarket/covid-safe-paths).

[Safeplaces Frontend](https://github.com/Path-Check/safeplaces-frontend) is an example client for these backends.

## Project Status

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ The project is still under development and will reach a Minimum Viable Product stage soon.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

The project is still under development and will reach a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage soon.  
*Note*: There can be breaking changes to the developing code until the MVP is released.

## Accessing Uploaded Data From Clients

[Safeplaces Ingest](https://github.com/Path-Check/safeplaces-backend-ingest) is a supporting backend service used by clients (including the SafePaths app) to upload data, which is then ingested by this service. In order to interact with the upload database, the following environment variables must be set:

```
DB_HOST_PUB=upload_db_host
DB_NAME_PUB=upload_db_name
DB_USER_PUB=uploa_db_user
DB_PASS_PUB=upload_db_password
```

## Publishing Files

Files can be published to either Google Cloud Storage (GCS) or AWS Simple Storage Service (S3). This preference is set via an environment variable. If not set, tests will default to local storage (write to disk) to pass. This variable is required in a production environment.

```
PUBLISH_STORAGE_TYPE=(gcs|aws)
```

#### Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

The following environment variables are required to upload files to GCS:

```
PUBLISH_STORAGE_TYPE=gcs
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS='google_service_account.json'
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=something
GCLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET=somethingOrOther
```

#### AWS Simple Storage Service (S3)

The following environment variables are required to upload files to AWS:

```
PUBLISH_STORAGE_TYPE=aws
S3_BUCKET=bucket-name
S3_REGION=region-name
S3_ACCESS_KEY=something
S3_SECRET_KEY=something-secret
```

## Deployment

### Deploy in local machine

*Note*:
1. The installation assumes you have already installed Postgres DB in your local environment listening for connections at port 5432.
2. Your Postgres instance should listen to '*' instead of 'localhost' by setting the `listen_addresses` parameter, [this setting can be found in your pgconfig file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-connection.html).

Clone this repository

```
cd safeplaces-backend/expressjs
```

#### Install Package Manager

Steps to install NVM are documented [in the nvm repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

Install npm using nvm

```
nvm install 13.1.0
nvm use 13.1.0
npm install
```

#### Setup Environment

Refer [.env.template](.env.template) for environment variables to be exported to your environment.

#### Setup LDAP Server
The basic, included LDAP server is to be used for testing purposes only.
It is not meant for production use.

Please see the OpenLDAP implementations for production-ready servers. Once set up, modify the environment
variables to point to the new server, with the proper host, port, password, domain components, and bind command.

Example:
```
LDAP_HOST=localhost
LDAP_PORT=1389
LDAP_PASS=safepaths
LDAP_ORG="dc=covidsafepaths, dc=org"
LDAP_BIND="cn=admin, dc=covidsafepaths, dc=org"
LDAP_SEARCH="cn={{username}}, dc=covidsafepaths, dc=org"
LDAP_FILTER="(objectClass=*)"
```

The Express server queries the LDAP server with each login request at `/login`.

The search query will look like
`cn={{username}}, dc=covidsafepaths, dc=org`

Note that `{{username}}` is **explicitly required.**
`{{username}}` will be replaced by the username sent by the client's request.

To run the server:
```
cd ldapjs/
npm install
npm start
```

#### Setup Database

1. Create the database exported in your environment.
```
createdb safeplaces
```
1. Create the user exported in your environment.
```
psql=# CREATE USER safepaths_user
```
1. Grant database user superuser privilege to the database to create POSTGIS extension and setup other tables. Reduce this privilege later to just create and modify tables or tuples in this database after you run the migration for the first time.
```
ALTER USER safepaths_user WITH SUPERUSER
```
After migration:
```
ALTER USER safepaths_user WITH NOSUPERUSER
```
1. Install [PostGIS extension](https://postgis.net/install/).

#### Knex migrations and seed the database

Install Knex globally

```
npm install knex -g
```

Run migrations

```
npm run migrate:up
```

Seed the database

```
npm run seed
```

#### Mocha unit tests

Install mocha globally.

```
npm install mocha -g
```

Run tests to ensure they pass

```
npm test
```

#### Start the server

```
npm start
```

### Deploy using Docker

*Note*:  
1. The installation assumes you have already installed Postgres DB in your local environment listening for connections at port 5432.
2. Your Postgres instance should listen to '*' instead of 'localhost' by setting the `listen_addresses` parameter, [this setting can be found in your pgconfig file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-connection.html).
3. Your `pg_hba.conf` should have a rule added for `host all all <docker-subnet> md5`. Replace `<docker-subnet>` with the actual CIDR for your docker installation's subnet. Note that `172.18.0.0/16` is usually the default.

Clone this repository

```
cd safeplaces-backend/expressjs
```

#### Build Dockerfile

```
docker build -t safeplaces-backend-expressjs .
```

#### Run Dockerfile

```
docker run --rm --name safeplaces-expressjs --env-file=.env -p 3000:3000 safeplaces-backend-expressjs
```

*Note*: sample env file can be found at .env.template`.

#### Deploy via docker-compose

 *Using docker-compose will bring a postgres server along with the application container*

Ensure to create application Environment variables  file .env from .env.template

Ensure to create Postgres Environment variables file  .database.env from .database.env.template

#### Run the following:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

### Testing Your Deployment

Run:

```
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

Should respond with:

```
{
  "message": "All Ok!"
}
```
